- Compile newpw.c somewhere and add it to your path. It's straight up C, and
  just serves to generate a new password of any length passed to it.

- Obtain aescrypt from http://www.aescrypt.com/download.html and put it
  somewhere in your path - it allows you to encrypt a file with a password of
  your choosing and will be what we use to encrypt our keychain.

- Ensure you have $XDG_DATA_HOME defined in your environment variables and run
  pwgen with

  ./pwgen
